*For comparison to pipsi, see [how does this compare to pipsi?](#how-does-this-compare-to-pipsi) and [migrating to pipx from pipsi](#migrating-to-pipx-from-pipsi).*

*pipx uses the word "binary" to describe a CLI application that can be run directly from the command line. These files are located in the `bin` directory of a Python installation, alongside other executables. Despite the name, they do not necessarily contain binary data.*

## Overview
Python and PyPI allow developers to distribute code with "console scripts". These scripts let users call into python code from the command line, effectively acting like standalone applications.

`pipx` is a tool to install and run any of the thousands of Python applications available on PyPI in a safe, convenient, and reliable way. Not all Python packages have entry points, but many do.

`pipx` lets you:
* Safely install packages to isolated virtual environments, while globally exposing their CLI entry points so you can run them from anywhere (see the `install` command)
* Easily list, upgrade, and uninstall packages that were installed with pipx
* Run the latest version of a CLI application in a temporary environment (see the `run` command)
* Run binaries from the `__pypackages__` directory per PEP 582 as companion tool to [pythonloc](https://github.com/cs01/pythonloc)

Best of all, pipx runs with regular user permissions, never calling `sudo pip install` (you aren't doing that, are you? 😄).

pipx is similar to JavaScript's [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) - which ships with npm, but also allows you to install instead of just run. pipx does not ship with pip but installing it is often an important part of bootstrapping your system.

### Safely installing to isolated environments
You can globally install a CLI application by running
```
pipx install PACKAGE
```

This automatically creates a virtual environment, installs the package, and adds the package's CLI entry points to a location on your `PATH`. For example, `pipx install pycowsay` makes the `pycowsay` command available globally, but sandboxes the pycowsay package in its own virtual environment. **pipx never needs to run as sudo to do this.**

Example:
```
>> pipx install pycowsay
  installed package pycowsay 2.0, Python 3.6.7
  These binaries are now globally available
    - pycowsay
done! ✨ 🌟 ✨

>> pipx list
venvs are in /home/user/.local/pipx/venvs
binaries are exposed on your $PATH at /home/user/.local/bin
   package pycowsay 2.0, Python 3.6.7
    - pycowsay

>> pycowsay moooo
  _____
< moooo >
  =====
          \
           \
             ^__^
             (oo)\_______
             (__)\       )\/       ||----w |
                 ||     ||
```

### Running in temporary, sandboxed environments
pipx makes running the latest version of a program in a temporary environment as easy as
```
pipx run BINARY [ARGS...]
```
This will install the package in an isolated, temporary directory and invoke the binary. Try it!

```
pipx run pycowsay moo
```

Notice that you **don't need to execute any install commands to run the binary**.

Re-running the same binary is quick because pipx caches Virtual Environments on a per-binary basis. These caches last two days.

You can run .py files directly, too.
```
pipx run https://gist.githubusercontent.com/cs01/fa721a17a326e551ede048c5088f9e0f/raw/6bdfbb6e9c1132b1c38fdd2f195d4a24c540c324/pipx-demo.py
pipx is working!
```

## Testimonials

"Thanks for improving the workflow that pipsi has covered in the past. Nicely done!"
— [Jannis Leidel](https://twitter.com/jezdez) PSF fellow and former pip maintainer

"Just the “pipx upgrade-all” command is already a huge win over pipsi"
— [Stefane Fermigier](https://twitter.com/sfermigier/status/1093073303521116160)

"This tool filled in the gap that was missing with pipenv and Virtual Environmentwrapper."
— [Mason Egger](https://medium.com/homeaway-tech-blog/simplify-your-python-developer-environment-aba90f32dddb)


### System Requirements
python 3.6+ is required to install pipx. pipx can run binaries from packages with Python 3.3+. Don't have Python 3.6 or later? See [Python 3 Installation & Setup Guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).

pipx works on macOS, linux, and Windows.

## Install pipx
```
pip install --user pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

to be sure you are using python3 you can run

```
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

### Using Development Versions
New versions of pipx are published as beta or release candidates. These versions look something like `0.13.0b1`, where `b1` signifies the first beta release of version 0.13. These releases can be tested with
```
pip install --user pipx --upgrade --dev
```
Development occurs on the `dev` branch of this repository. If there is no such branch, that means there is no work currently in development for a new version.

#### `pipx inject` example

One use of the inject command is setting up a REPL with some useful extra packages.

```
pipx install ptpython
pipx inject ptpython requests pendulum
```

After running the above commands, you will be able to import and use the `requests` and `pendulum` packages inside a `ptpython` repl.

> pipx list
venvs are in /Users/user/.local/pipx/venvs
binaries are exposed on your $PATH at /Users/user/.local/bin
   package black 18.9b0, Python 3.7.0
    - black
    - blackd
   package pipx 0.10.0, Python 3.7.0
    - pipx
```

### pipx runpip
{{runpip}}


### pipx ensurepath
{{ensurepath}}

#### `pipx ensurepath` example
```
> pipx ensurepath
Added /home/user/.local/bin to the PATH environment variable in /home/user/.bashrc

Open a new terminal to use pipx ✨ 🌟 ✨
```
```
> pipx ensurepath
Your PATH looks like it already is set up for pipx. Pass `--force` to modify the PATH.
```
## Programs to try with pipx
Here are some programs you can try out. If you've never used the program before, make sure you add the `--help` flag so it doesn't do something you don't expect. If you decide you want to install, you can run `pipx install PACKAGE` instead.
```
pipx install ansible  # IT automation
pipx run asciinema  # Record and share your terminal sessions, the right way.
pipx run black  # uncompromising Python code formatter
pipx --spec babel run pybabel  # internationalizing and localizing Python applications
pipx --spec chardet run chardetect  # detect file encoding
pipx run cookiecutter  # creates projects from project templates
pipx run create-python-package  # easily create and publish new Python packages
pipx run flake8  # tool for style guide enforcement
pipx run gdbgui  # browser-based gdb debugger
pipx run hexsticker  # create hexagon stickers automatically
pipx run ipython  # powerful interactive Python shell
pipx run jupyter  # web-based notebook environment for interactive computing
pipx run pipenv  # python dependency/environment management
pipx run poetry  # python dependency/environment/packaging management
pipx run pylint  # source code analyzer
pipx run pyinstaller  # bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package
pipx run pyxtermjs  # fully functional terminal in the browser  
pipx install shell-functools  # Functional programming tools for the shell
```

## How it Works
When installing a package and its binaries (`pipx install package`) pipx will
* create directory ~/.local/pipx/venvs/PACKAGE
* create a Virtual Environment in ~/.local/pipx/venvs/PACKAGE
* update the Virtual Environment's pip to the latest version
* install the desired package in the Virtual Environment
* exposes binaries at `~/.local/bin` that point to new binaries in `~/.local/pipx/venvs/PACKAGE/bin` (such as `~/.local/bin/black` -> `~/.local/pipx/venvs/black/bin/black`)
* As long as `~/.local/bin/` is on your PATH, you can now invoke the new binaries globally

When running a binary (`pipx run BINARY`), pipx will
* Create a temporary directory (or reuse a cached virtual environment for this package) with a name based on a hash of the attributes that make the run reproducible. This includes things like the package name, spec, python version, and pip arguments.
* create a Virtual Environment inside it with `python -m venv`
* update pip to the latest version
* install the desired package in the Virtual Environment
* invoke the binary


These are all things you can do yourself, but pipx automates them for you. If you are curious as to what pipx is doing behind the scenes, you can always pass the `--verbose` flag to see every single command and argument being run.

## Contributing
To develop `pipx` first clone the repository, then create and activate a virtual environment.
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Next install pipx in "editable mode".
```
pip install -e .
```
Now make your changes and run `pipx` as you normally would. Your changes will be used as soon as they are saved.

Make sure your changes pass tests by installing development dependencies
```
pip install -e .[dev]
```
then running tests
```
python setup.py test
```
If you added or modified any command line argument parsers, be sure to regenerate the README.md.
```
make docs
```

When finished, you can exit the virtual environment by running `deactivate` and remove the virtual environment with `rm -r venv`.

## How does this compare to pipsi?
* pipx is under active development. pipsi is no longer maintained.
* pipx and pipsi both install packages in a similar way
* pipx always makes sure you're using the latest version of pip
* pipx has the ability to run a binary in one line, leaving your system unchanged after it finishes (`pipx run BINARY`) where pipsi does not
* pipx has the ability to recursively install binaries from dependent packages
* pipx adds more useful information to its output
* pipx has more CLI options such as upgrade-all, reinstall-all, uninstall-all
* pipx is more modern. It uses Python 3.6+, and the `venv` package in the Python3 standard library instead of the python 2 package `virtualenv`.
* pipx works with Python homebrew installations while pipsi does not (at least on my machine)
* pipx defaults to less verbose output
* pipx allows you to see each command it runs by passing the --verbose flag
* pipx prints emojies 😀

## Migrating to pipx from pipsi
Although `pipx` does not provide an automatic migration command,
it is pretty easy to do it from the command-line:

```bash
# install pipx with the recommended method
pip install --user pipx
pipx ensurepath
# you may have to open a new terminal here for pipx to be on your PATH

# migrate from pipsi to pipx
pipsi list | grep 'Package ' | cut -d\" -f2 | \
  while read -r p; do
    pipsi uninstall --yes "$p"
    # reinstall everything with python 3.6
    pipx install --python python3.6 "$p"
  done

# clean up
rm -rf ~/.local/pipsi
rm ~/.local/bin/pipsi
```

If you want to do this manually, you will have to remove pipsi's directory completely then reinstall everything with pipx.

First remove pipsi's directory (this is its default)
```
rm -r ~/.local/pipsi
```

There will still be files in `~/.local/bin` that point to `~/.local/pipsi/venvs`. If you reinstall the same packages with `pipx`, the files will be overwritten with valid files that point to the new pipx directory in `~/.local/pipx/venvs`. You may also want to remove files in `~/.local/bin`, but be sure the files you delete there were created by pipsi.

## How does this compare with `pip-run`?
[pip-run](https://github.com/jaraco/pip-run) is focused on running **arbitrary Python code in ephemeral environments** while pipx is focused on running **Python binaries in ephemeral and non-ephemeral environments**.

For example these two commands both install poetry to an ephemeral environment and invoke poetry with `--help`.
```
pipx run poetry --help
pip-run poetry -- -m poetry --help
```
